# Web UI for the Lattice Surgery Quantum Error Correction Compiler

### Setup
```
$ cd ls-ui-react-app
$ npm install
```
Run the dev server with 
`$ npm start`

Once the server starts you should see your changes appearing live, without even having to reload.

If the error messages are very concise, try dumping the stdout to a file to read the output:

```npm start > errmsg.txt || cat errmsg.txt``` 


Check out the readme in the `ls-ui-react-app` folder for more on how to work with the react app
